## [react-charts](https://qur786.github.io/Chart-React-App/)

This mini project is developed using React, TypeScript, and EChartsJS (a JavaScript chart library). It showcases two types of charts:

1. Bar Chart: Illustrates a bar graph for three classes of wine against their average malic acid content.
2. Scatter Chart: Demonstrates the scatter relation between Color Intensity (Horizontal Axis) and Hue (Vertical Axis).

## Dataset
The project utilizes the [Wine dataset from UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine), consisting of 13 attributes and 178 records.

## Mobile Responsiveness
The project prioritizes mobile responsiveness to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.

## Building the Project

This React app is built and deployed using the gh-pages module, which hosts the project on the GitHub server. To build the project locally, execute the **"yarn build"** command in the terminal. This command bundles the source code into static files and provides a link to access the bundled app through the local server's port.

The repository contains the **Source Code** of the Chart-React-App built with CRA. To build this project locally, fetch the **Source Code**, navigate to the directory, and run **yarn build** in the terminal, creating a **build** folder.

## Running the Project

After building the project, serve the build app using a **"Static Server"**. Utilize the **"serve -s build"** command, initiating a server likely at port 5000 of the localhost. If the serve module isn't installed, use **yarn add serve** to install it. Upon executing **"serve -s build"**, access the **Chart-React-App** at the specified link or port.
